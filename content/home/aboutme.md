  My name is Sebastian Leal, I'm a multimedia creator and I specialize in
  filmmaking, photography, and graphic design and I'm based in the vibrant DFW,
  Texas. I got my Bachelors in Cinematic Arts in the University of Texas at
  Arlington. 


  I've always been drawn to the world of art and creativity, and my passion for storytelling and visual communication led me to pursue a career in the creative industries. Over the years, I've honed my skills and developed a diverse portfolio of work that spans across multiple mediums.


  In all of my work, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible and exploring new creative frontiers. Whether it's experimenting with new camera techniques or learning the latest design software, I'm always seeking new ways to expand my skillset and bring fresh perspectives to my work.


  If you're looking for a passionate and talented creative professional to bring your vision to life, look no further. I'd love to hear more about your project and how I can help you achieve your goals.
