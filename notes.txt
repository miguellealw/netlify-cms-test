### When using console.log sometimes it is logged in the browser console (client) and sometimes in the server console (server). It depends where you call console.log


### AFTER ISSUES WITH NUXT MUTATIONS
problem: when a mutation was called in asyncData app would break w/ no warnings or errors

some solution: instead of calling this.$store.state.<module_name>.<muation> i got the store from the context passed into the asyncData function and used commit on that (store.commit("<mutaion_name>", mut_args))

using mapMutations and calling this.<mut_name> does not seem to work...



### 'this' is not accessible from certain vue places in the 'export default {}' in vue
  - 'this' is accessible from computed properties 
  - 'this' is not accessible from asyncData and methods, but can access certain things from the context passed into the function


### Issue - if data has already been fetched do not fetch again
  - NOT SOLUTION - cannot just fetch in gallery/index.vue b/c if a sub page like Photography is visited first then the data will not be fetched
